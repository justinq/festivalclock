# The Edinburgh Festival Clock

The [Edinburgh Festival Clock][festivalclock] is a visualisation commissioned by the [Edinburgh Festivals Innovation Lab][festivalslab] and supported by the INTERREG IVB North-West Europe Programme.  It was designed by [Stefanie Posavec][stef], developed by me and built using the new [Summer Festivals Listings API][festivalsapi].

See it in action at [festivalclock.com][festivalclock].
